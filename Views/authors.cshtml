          <h4>Joe Parsley</h4>
          <p>
            The product of two loving, arabian unicorns, Joe is a fantabulous individual with just an overwhelming passion for Nicki Minaj. If you don't find him on the praerie prancing around with the other Unicorns in the neighborhood, you'll find him at home bobbing his head to the latest Minaj-erie.

          <h4>Jared Luedtke</h4>
          <p>
            Jared is one of 18,000 deer that were cloned in a lab in Iceland. While deer aren't normally wandering around in their country, the scientists thought it would be "a nice change from pace". The scientists soon realized that it was a terrible idea releasing them into the wild after ~99% of the deer population fell off due to traffic incidents. Jared is the sole remaining Icelandic deer.

          <h4>Charles Emrich</h4>
          <p>
            Born as a boy even though his parents wanted a robot, Unit 24-B-9 (Charles, for short), has founded his whole life based upon one single, ultimate, powerful, obscene, goal; to become the greatest surfer the world has ever known. Together with his colony of penguins and the aid of the Beach Boys, Charles... Let's be honest, he's never going to be a good surfer.

          <h4>Jared Eiseman</h4>
          <p>
            The unholy union of a meteorite and a sea witch birthed an abomination heretofor unknown. When he finally shambled ashore, after a difficult childhood spent hunting small fish, Jared discovered an aptitude for machinery that some would consider... unnatural. He has promised to help the world with his gifts, but the persistent smell of fish has kept the world from wanting to help him.

        <h2>About Our Application</h2>
        <p>
          Nicki Min-API is a RESTful Application Program Interface for information regarding Nicki Minaj music. The inception of this idea was spawned from a project we discovered by the name of <a href="http://www.kanyerest.xyz/">Kanye REST</a>, and modified to be used for an <a href="https://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a> Group Week Project as an exercise in developing the front-end of a site alongside the back end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The technology stack we chose to use to implement this idea was using C#, with Nancy for routing, the Razor view engine, and MySQL for database management. For the front end, we are building upon the Razor view engine with Nancy routing, utilizing Sass to write our styles in SCSS format, with the aid of Bourbon and Neat libraries to streamline the design process.
